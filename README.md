This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class, allowing for detailed understanding and localization of objects within the scene.

The U-Net architecture, introduced by Ronneberger et al. in 2015, has proven to be highly effective for image segmentation tasks. This repository serves as a guide and codebase for building and training a U-Net model for your own semantic segmentation projects.
